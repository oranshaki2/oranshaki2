## Hi there 👋 My name is Oran Shaki
### 🙋‍♂️ About me
I am a Computer Science student at Bar-Ilan university (BIU). 

Throughout my studies, I have worked with various programming languages and tools, and gained knowledge in a wide range of topics-

from mathematics, algorithms, and data structures to object-oriented programming and computer architecture.

### 🔭 I’m currently working on
🎵 **Language Learning App Using Songs** | *Python, NLP, Machine Learning* 

- Designed and trained a machine learning model using a Multi-Layer Perceptron to classify songs

  into thematic vocabulary categories.
  
- Integrated external API calls to GROK to classify individual words by difficulty level,
  
  enabling dynamic vocabulary progression tailored to the user's level.
  
- Independently studied and applied NLP techniques to preprocess lyrics and improve model performance,
  
  using tokenization and TF-IDF vectorization.
